**Business scenario**

To enhance the efficiency of operating medical information and the security and privacy of patients' data, a Healthcare Management System(HMS) Database is necessary. This database contains patient data, medical records, appointment scheduling, billing information, and staff management. There are several business scenarios that require information to be entered into the HMS database, as follows.

First, new patients provide their personal and medical history information upon their first visit. Therefore, they have a unique patient profile in the HMS database that includes contact information, medical history, allergies, and insurance details. Second, patients can schedule appointments online. The HMS Database helps manage doctor schedules and send appointment reminders to patients. In addition, doctors and medical staff will update patients' treatment plans, prescriptions, and test results directly into the patient's electronic medical records within the HMS Database. Also, the billing information is stored in the HMS database, allowing patients to track payments and balances. Most importantly, sensitive information like social security numbers and passwords are encrypted within the database.
